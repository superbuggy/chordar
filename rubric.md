## Technical Requirements
Performing/Excelling- Though the app only contains two models, there's some pretty complex logic happening in the chords controller that warrants some accolades. Nice job! A many-to-many relationship might be something to consider between notes and chords. It'd be cool to see in the database all chords that have a given note.

## Creativity and Interface
Performing- Though the logic is great, the UI isn't terrible intuitive.  I'm not really sure what recent chords means( i know it means the index ) but not sure what it means in the context of the application in totality. Chord creation doesn't have labels for the drop downs so users have to intuit what to do. Additionally there's nothing beyond just building and displaying the chords. It'd be really great if there was some kind of visualization of a chord or even better might be the sound of the chord. That would be dope.

## Code Quality
Excelling- Really great code quality. Code is propertly indented(almost all of it at least). The best thing that I noticed is that your code is extremely well commented. This is super helpful for any would be collaborators and more importantly future you. Also you separated your concerns and kept business logic in your model.

## Deployment and Functionality
Performing- App is deployed and functional on heroku. Great!

## Planning/Process/Submission
Incomplete - No evidence of any user stories, ERD's  wireframes or readme. Planning is really important! It can help you greatly in prototyping as well as some providing guidance as to which features to implement. Readme's are very important in general for web applications. They usually provide information for setup/configuration, future goals, ERD's, process and implementation.

## Overall
I'm really happy with the progress you've made thus far. This project reflects a good baseline understanding of the rails framework.  Really great work with custom instance methods for your models.
